  ## Placing Orders

This endpoint is used for placing orders. See individual fields below for more details on their use.

#### Order Types

All orders require a `symbol`. All other fields are optional except when otherwise specified.

These are the valid `ordType`s:

- **Limit**: The default order type. Specify an `orderQty` and `price`.
- **Market**: A traditional Market order. A Market order will execute until filled or your bankruptcy price is reached, at
  which point it will cancel.
- **Stop**: A Stop Market order. Specify an `orderQty` and `stopPx`. When the `stopPx` is reached, the order will be entered
  into the book.
  - On sell orders, the order will trigger if the triggering price is lower than the `stopPx`. On buys, higher.
  - Note: Stop orders do not consume margin until triggered. Be sure that the required margin is available in your
    account so that it may trigger fully.
  - `Close` Stops don't require an `orderQty`. See Execution Instructions below.
- **StopLimit**: Like a Stop Market, but enters a Limit order instead of a Market order. Specify an `orderQty`, `stopPx`,
  and `price`.
- **MarketIfTouched**: Similar to a Stop, but triggers are done in the opposite direction. Useful for Take Profit orders.
- **LimitIfTouched**: As above; use for Take Profit Limit orders.
- **Pegged**: Pegged orders allow users to submit a limit price relative to the current market price. Specify a
  `pegPriceType`, and `pegOffsetValue`.
  - Pegged orders **must** have an `execInst` of `Fixed`. This means the limit price is set at the time the order
    is accepted and does not change as the reference price changes.
  - `PrimaryPeg`: Price is set relative to near touch price.
  - `MarketPeg`: Price is set relative to far touch price.
  - A `pegPriceType` submitted with no `ordType` is treated as a `Pegged` order.

#### Execution Instructions

The following `execInst`s are supported. If using multiple, separate with a comma (e.g. `LastPrice,Close`).

- **ParticipateDoNotInitiate**: Also known as a Post-Only order. If this order would have executed on placement, it will cancel instead.
  This is intended to protect you from the far touch moving towards you while the order is in transit.
  It is not intended for speculating on the far touch moving away after submission - we consider such behaviour abusive and monitor for it.
- **MarkPrice, LastPrice, IndexPrice**: Used by stop and if-touched orders to determine the triggering price.
  Use only one. By default, `MarkPrice` is used. Also used for Pegged orders to define the value of `LastPeg`.
- **ReduceOnly**: A `ReduceOnly` order can only reduce your position, not increase it. If you have a `ReduceOnly`
  limit order that rests in the order book while the position is reduced by other orders, then its order quantity will
  be amended down or canceled. If there are multiple `ReduceOnly` orders the least aggressive will be amended first.
- **Close**: `Close` implies `ReduceOnly`. A `Close` order will cancel other active limit orders with the same side
  and symbol if the open quantity exceeds the current position. This is useful for stops: by canceling these orders, a
  `Close` Stop is ensured to have the margin required to execute, and can only execute up to the full size of your
  position. If `orderQty` is not specified, a `Close` order has an `orderQty` equal to your current position's size.
  - Note that a `Close` order without an `orderQty` requires a `side`, so that BitMEX knows if it should trigger
    above or below the `stopPx`.
- **LastWithinMark**: Used by stop orders with `LastPrice` to allow stop triggers only when:
  - For Sell Stop Market / Stop Limit Order
    - Last Price &lt= Stop Price
    - Last Price &gt= Mark Price × (1 - 5%)
  - For Buy Stop Market / Stop Limit Order:
    - Last Price &gt= Stop Price
    - Last Price &lt= Mark Price × (1 + 5%)
- **Fixed**: Pegged orders **must** have an `execInst` of `Fixed`. This means the limit price is set at the time
  the order is accepted and does not change as the reference price changes.

#### Pegged Orders

Pegged orders allow users to submit a limit price relative to the current market price.
The limit price is set once when the order is submitted and does not change with the reference price.
This order type is not intended for speculating on the far touch moving away after submission - we consider such behaviour abusive and monitor for it.

Pegged orders have an `ordType` of `Pegged`, and an `execInst` of `Fixed`.

A `pegPriceType` and `pegOffsetValue` must also be submitted:

- `PrimaryPeg` - price is set relative to the **near touch** price
- `MarketPeg` - price is set relative to the **far touch** price

#### Trailing Stop Pegged Orders

Use `pegPriceType` of `TrailingStopPeg` to create Trailing Stops.

The price is set at submission and updates once per second if the underlying price (last/mark/index) has moved by
more than 0.1%. `stopPx` then moves as the market moves away from the peg, and freezes as the market moves toward it.

Use `pegOffsetValue` to set the `stopPx` of your order. The peg is set to the triggering price specified in the
`execInst` (default `MarkPrice`). Use a negative offset for stop-sell and buy-if-touched orders.

Requires `ordType`: `Stop`, `StopLimit`, `MarketIfTouched`, `LimitIfTouched`.

#### Linked Orders

[Linked Orders are deprecated as of 2018/11/10](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/deprecation-of-contingent-orders/)

#### Trailing Stops

You may use `pegPriceType` of `'TrailingStopPeg'` to create Trailing Stops. The pegged `stopPx` will move as the market
moves away from the peg, and freeze as the market moves toward it.

To use, combine with `pegOffsetValue` to set the `stopPx` of your order. The peg is set to the triggering price
specified in the `execInst` (default `'MarkPrice'`). Use a negative offset for stop-sell and buy-if-touched orders.

Requires `ordType`: `'Stop', 'StopLimit', 'MarketIfTouched', 'LimitIfTouched'`.

#### Simple Quantities

[Simple Quantities are deprecated as of 2018/10/26](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/deprecation-of-simpleorderqty-functionality/)

#### Rate Limits

See the [Bulk Order Documentation](#!/Order/Order_newBulk) if you need to place multiple orders at the same time.
Bulk orders require fewer risk checks in the trading engine and thus are ratelimited at **1/10** the normal rate.

You can also improve your reactivity to market movements while staying under your ratelimit by using the
[Amend](#!/Order/Order_amend) and [Amend Bulk](#!/Order/Order_amendBulk) endpoints. This allows you to stay
in the market and avoids the cancel/replace cycle.

#### Tracking Your Orders

If you want to keep track of order IDs yourself, set a unique `clOrdID` per order.
This `clOrdID` will come back as a property on the order and any related executions (including on the WebSocket),
and can be used to get or cancel the order. Max length is 36 characters.

You can also change the `clOrdID` by amending an order, supplying an `origClOrdID`, and your desired new
ID as the `clOrdID` param, like so:

```
# Amends an order's leavesQty, and updates its clOrdID to \"def-456\"
PUT /api/v1/order {\"origClOrdID\": \"abc-123\", \"clOrdID\": \"def-456\", \"leavesQty\": 1000}

- `MarketPeg` - price is set relative to the **far touch** price

#### Trailing Stop Pegged Orders

Use `pegPriceType` of `TrailingStopPeg` to create Trailing Stops.

The price is set at submission and updates once per second if the underlying price (last/mark/index) has moved by
more than 0.1%. `stopPx` then moves as the market moves away from the peg, and freezes as the market moves toward it.

Use `pegOffsetValue` to set the `stopPx` of your order. The peg is set to the triggering price specified in the

Requires `ordType`: `Stop`, `StopLimit`, `MarketIfTouched`, `LimitIfTouched`.

#### Linked Orders

[Linked Orders are deprecated as of 2018/11/10](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/deprecation-of-contingent-orders/)
