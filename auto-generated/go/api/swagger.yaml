  description: "## REST API for the BitMEX Trading Platform\n\n_If you are building\
    \ automated tools, please subscribe to the_\n_[BitMEX API RSS Feed](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/feed/)\
    \ for changes. The feed will be updated_\n_regularly and is the most reliable\
    \ way to get downtime and update announcements._\n\n[View Changelog](/app/apiChangelog)\n\
    \n-\n\n#### Getting Started\n\nBase URI: [https://www.bitmex.com/api/v1](/api/v1)\n\
    \n##### Fetching Data\n\nAll REST endpoints are documented below. You can try\
    \ out any query right from this interface.\n\nMost table queries accept `count`,\
    \ `start`, and `reverse` params. Set `reverse=true` to get rows newest-first.\n\
    \nAdditional documentation regarding filters, timestamps, and authentication\n\
    is available in [the main API documentation](/app/restAPI).\n\n_All_ table data\
    \ is available via the [Websocket](/app/wsAPI). We highly recommend using the\
    \ socket if you want\nto have the quickest possible data without being subject\
    \ to ratelimits.\n\n##### Return Types\n\nBy default, all data is returned as\
    \ JSON. Send `?_format=csv` to get CSV data or `?_format=xml` to get XML data.\n\
    \n##### Trade Data Queries\n\n_This is only a small subset of what is available,\
    \ to get you started._\n\nFill in the parameters and click the `Try it out!` button\
    \ to try any of these queries.\n\n- [Pricing Data](#!/Quote/Quote_get)\n\n- [Trade\
    \ Data](#!/Trade/Trade_get)\n\n- [OrderBook Data](#!/OrderBook/OrderBook_getL2)\n\
    \n- [Settlement Data](#!/Settlement/Settlement_get)\n\n- [Exchange Statistics](#!/Stats/Stats_history)\n\
    \nEvery function of the BitMEX.com platform is exposed here and documented. Many\
    \ more functions are available.\n\n##### Swagger Specification\n\n[⇩ Download\

      description: "## Placing Orders\n\nThis endpoint is used for placing orders.\
        \ See individual fields below for more details on their use.\n\n#### Order\
        \ Types\n\nAll orders require a `symbol`. All other fields are optional except\
        \ when otherwise specified.\n\nThese are the valid `ordType`s:\n\n- **Limit**:\
        \ The default order type. Specify an `orderQty` and `price`.\n- **Market**:\
        \ A traditional Market order. A Market order will execute until filled or\
        \ your bankruptcy price is reached, at\n  which point it will cancel.\n- **Stop**:\
        \ A Stop Market order. Specify an `orderQty` and `stopPx`. When the `stopPx`\
        \ is reached, the order will be entered\n  into the book.\n  - On sell orders,\
        \ the order will trigger if the triggering price is lower than the `stopPx`.\
        \ On buys, higher.\n  - Note: Stop orders do not consume margin until triggered.\
        \ Be sure that the required margin is available in your\n    account so that\
        \ it may trigger fully.\n  - `Close` Stops don't require an `orderQty`. See\
        \ Execution Instructions below.\n- **StopLimit**: Like a Stop Market, but\
        \ enters a Limit order instead of a Market order. Specify an `orderQty`, `stopPx`,\n\
        \  and `price`.\n- **MarketIfTouched**: Similar to a Stop, but triggers are\
        \ done in the opposite direction. Useful for Take Profit orders.\n- **LimitIfTouched**:\
        \ As above; use for Take Profit Limit orders.\n- **Pegged**: Pegged orders\
        \ allow users to submit a limit price relative to the current market price.\
        \ Specify a\n  `pegPriceType`, and `pegOffsetValue`.\n  - Pegged orders **must**\
        \ have an `execInst` of `Fixed`. This means the limit price is set at the\
        \ time the order\n    is accepted and does not change as the reference price\
        \ changes.\n  - `PrimaryPeg`: Price is set relative to near touch price.\n\
        \  - `MarketPeg`: Price is set relative to far touch price.\n  - A `pegPriceType`\
        \ submitted with no `ordType` is treated as a `Pegged` order.\n\n#### Execution\
        \ Instructions\n\nThe following `execInst`s are supported. If using multiple,\
        \ separate with a comma (e.g. `LastPrice,Close`).\n\n- **ParticipateDoNotInitiate**:\
        \ Also known as a Post-Only order. If this order would have executed on placement,\
        \ it will cancel instead.\n  This is intended to protect you from the far\
        \ touch moving towards you while the order is in transit.\n  It is not intended\
        \ for speculating on the far touch moving away after submission - we consider\
        \ such behaviour abusive and monitor for it.\n- **MarkPrice, LastPrice, IndexPrice**:\
        \ Used by stop and if-touched orders to determine the triggering price.\n\
        \  Use only one. By default, `MarkPrice` is used. Also used for Pegged orders\
        \ to define the value of `LastPeg`. IndexPrice is not applicable to spot trading\
        \ symbols.\n- **ReduceOnly**: A `ReduceOnly` order can only reduce your position,\
        \ not increase it. If you have a `ReduceOnly`\n  limit order that rests in\
        \ the order book while the position is reduced by other orders, then its order\
        \ quantity will\n  be amended down or canceled. If there are multiple `ReduceOnly`\
        \ orders the least aggressive will be amended first. Not applicable to spot\
        \ trading symbols.\n- **Close**: `Close` implies `ReduceOnly`. A `Close` order\
        \ will cancel other active limit orders with the same side\n  and symbol if\
        \ the open quantity exceeds the current position. This is useful for stops:\
        \ by canceling these orders, a\n  `Close` Stop is ensured to have the margin\
        \ required to execute, and can only execute up to the full size of your\n\
        \  position. If `orderQty` is not specified, a `Close` order has an `orderQty`\
        \ equal to your current position's size. Not applicable to spot trading symbols.\n\
        \  - Note that a `Close` order without an `orderQty` requires a `side`, so\
        \ that BitMEX knows if it should trigger\n    above or below the `stopPx`.\n\
        - **LastWithinMark**: Used by stop orders with `LastPrice` to allow stop triggers\
        \ only when:\n  - For Sell Stop Market / Stop Limit Order\n    - Last Price\
        \ &lt= Stop Price\n    - Last Price &gt= Mark Price × (1 - 5%)\n  - For Buy\
        \ Stop Market / Stop Limit Order:\n    - Last Price &gt= Stop Price\n    -\
        \ Last Price &lt= Mark Price × (1 + 5%)\n  - Not applicable to spot trading\
        \ symbols.\n- **Fixed**: Pegged orders **must** have an `execInst` of `Fixed`.\
        \ This means the limit price is set at the time\n  the order is accepted and\
        \ does not change as the reference price changes.\n\n#### Pegged Orders\n\n\
        Pegged orders allow users to submit a limit price relative to the current\
        \ market price.\nThe limit price is set once when the order is submitted and\
        \ does not change with the reference price.\nThis order type is not intended\
        \ for speculating on the far touch moving away after submission - we consider\
        \ such behaviour abusive and monitor for it.\n\nPegged orders have an `ordType`\
        \ of `Pegged`, and an `execInst` of `Fixed`.\n\nA `pegPriceType` and `pegOffsetValue`\
        \ must also be submitted:\n\n- `PrimaryPeg` - price is set relative to the\
        \ **near touch** price\n- `MarketPeg` - price is set relative to the **far\
        \ touch** price\n\n#### Trailing Stop Pegged Orders\n\nUse `pegPriceType`\
        \ of `TrailingStopPeg` to create Trailing Stops.\n\nThe price is set at submission\
        \ and updates once per second if the underlying price (last/mark/index) has\
        \ moved by\nmore than 0.1%. `stopPx` then moves as the market moves away from\
        \ the peg, and freezes as the market moves toward it.\n\nUse `pegOffsetValue`\
        \ to set the `stopPx` of your order. The peg is set to the triggering price\
        \ specified in the\n`execInst` (default `MarkPrice`). Use a negative offset\
        \ for stop-sell and buy-if-touched orders.\n\nRequires `ordType`: `Stop`,\
        \ `StopLimit`, `MarketIfTouched`, `LimitIfTouched`.\n\n#### Linked Orders\n\
        \nLinked Orders are an advanced capability. It is very powerful, but its use\
        \ requires careful coding and testing.\nPlease follow this document carefully\
        \ and use the [Testnet Exchange](https://testnet.bitmex.com) while developing.\n\
        \nBitMEX offers four advanced Linked Order types:\n\n- **OCO**: _One Cancels\
        \ the Other_. A very flexible version of the standard Stop / Take Profit technique.\n\
        \  Multiple orders may be linked together using a single `clOrdLinkID`. Send\
        \ a `contingencyType` of\n  `OneCancelsTheOther` on the orders. The first\
        \ order that fully or partially executes (or activates\n  for `Stop` orders)\
        \ will cancel all other orders with the same `clOrdLinkID`.\n- **OTO**: _One\
        \ Triggers the Other_. Send a `contingencyType` of `'OneTriggersTheOther'`\
        \ on the primary order and\n  then subsequent orders with the same `clOrdLinkID`\
        \ will be not be triggered until the primary order fully executes.\n\n####\
        \ Trailing Stops\n\nYou may use `pegPriceType` of `'TrailingStopPeg'` to create\
        \ Trailing Stops. The pegged `stopPx` will move as the market\nmoves away\
        \ from the peg, and freeze as the market moves toward it.\n\nTo use, combine\
        \ with `pegOffsetValue` to set the `stopPx` of your order. The peg is set\
        \ to the triggering price\nspecified in the `execInst` (default `'MarkPrice'`).\
        \ Use a negative offset for stop-sell and buy-if-touched orders.\n\nRequires\
        \ `ordType`: `'Stop', 'StopLimit', 'MarketIfTouched', 'LimitIfTouched'`.\n\
        \n#### Simple Quantities\n\n[Simple Quantities are deprecated as of 2018/10/26](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/deprecation-of-simpleorderqty-functionality/)\n\
        \n#### Rate Limits\n\nYou can improve your reactivity to market movements\
        \ while staying under your rate limit by using the\n[Amend](#!/Order/Order_amend)\
        \ endpoint (PUT /order). This allows you to stay\nin the market and avoids\
        \ the cancel/replace cycle.\n\n#### Tracking Your Orders\n\nIf you want to\
        \ keep track of order IDs yourself, set a unique `clOrdID` per order.\nThis\
        \ `clOrdID` will come back as a property on the order and any related executions\
        \ (including on the WebSocket),\nand can be used to get or cancel the order.\
        \ Max length is 36 characters.\n\nYou can also change the `clOrdID` by amending\
        \ an order, supplying an `origClOrdID`, and your desired new\nID as the `clOrdID`\
        \ param, like so:\n\n```\n# Amends an order's leavesQty, and updates its clOrdID\
        \ to \"def-456\"\nPUT /api/v1/order {\"origClOrdID\": \"abc-123\", \"clOrdID\"\
        : \"def-456\", \"leavesQty\": 1000}\n```\n"
