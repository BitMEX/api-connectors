* BitMEX API
* ## REST API for the BitMEX Trading Platform  _If you are building automated tools, please subscribe to the_ _[BitMEX API RSS Feed](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/feed/) for changes. The feed will be updated_ _regularly and is the most reliable way to get downtime and update announcements._  [View Changelog](/app/apiChangelog)  ---  #### Getting Started  Base URI: [https://www.bitmex.com/api/v1](/api/v1)  ##### Fetching Data  All REST endpoints are documented below. You can try out any query right from this interface.  Most table queries accept `count`, `start`, and `reverse` params. Set `reverse=true` to get rows newest-first.  Additional documentation regarding filters, timestamps, and authentication is available in [the main API documentation](/app/restAPI).  _All_ table data is available via the [Websocket](/app/wsAPI). We highly recommend using the socket if you want to have the quickest possible data without being subject to ratelimits.  ##### Return Types  By default, all data is returned as JSON. Send `?_format=csv` to get CSV data or `?_format=xml` to get XML data.  ##### Trade Data Queries  _This is only a small subset of what is available, to get you started._  Fill in the parameters and click the `Try it out!` button to try any of these queries.  - [Pricing Data](#!/Quote/Quote_get)  - [Trade Data](#!/Trade/Trade_get)  - [OrderBook Data](#!/OrderBook/OrderBook_getL2)  - [Settlement Data](#!/Settlement/Settlement_get)  - [Exchange Statistics](#!/Stats/Stats_history)  Every function of the BitMEX.com platform is exposed here and documented.

/// Amend the quantity or price of an open order.
/// Send an `orderID` or `origClOrdID` to identify the order you wish to amend.  Both order quantity and price can be amended. Only one `qty` field can be used to amend.  Use the `leavesQty` field to specify how much of the order you wish to remain open. This can be useful if you want to adjust your position's delta by a certain amount, regardless of how much of the order has already filled.  > A `leavesQty` can be used to make a \"Filled\" order live again, if it is received within 60 seconds of the fill.  Like order placement, amending can be done in bulk. Simply send a request to `PUT /api/v1/order/bulk` with a JSON body of the shape: `{\"orders\": [{...}, {...}]}`, each object containing the fields used in this endpoint.

/// Create a new order.
/// ## Placing Orders  This endpoint is used for placing orders. See individual fields below for more details on their use.  #### Order Types  All orders require a `symbol`. All other fields are optional except when otherwise specified.  These are the valid `ordType`s:  - **Limit**: The default order type. Specify an `orderQty` and `price`. - **Market**: A traditional Market order. A Market order will execute until filled or your bankruptcy price is reached, at   which point it will cancel. - **Stop**: A Stop Market order. Specify an `orderQty` and `stopPx`. When the `stopPx` is reached, the order will be entered   into the book.   - On sell orders, the order will trigger if the triggering price is lower than the `stopPx`. On buys, higher.   - Note: Stop orders do not consume margin until triggered. Be sure that the required margin is available in your     account so that it may trigger fully.   - `Close` Stops don't require an `orderQty`. See Execution Instructions below. - **StopLimit**: Like a Stop Market, but enters a Limit order instead of a Market order. Specify an `orderQty`, `stopPx`,   and `price`. - **MarketIfTouched**: Similar to a Stop, but triggers are done in the opposite direction. Useful for Take Profit orders. - **LimitIfTouched**: As above; use for Take Profit Limit orders. - **Pegged**: Pegged orders allow users to submit a limit price relative to the current market price. Specify a   `pegPriceType`, and `pegOffsetValue`.   - Pegged orders **must** have an `execInst` of `Fixed`. This means the limit price is set at the time the order     is accepted and does not change as the reference price changes.   - `PrimaryPeg`: Price is set relative to near touch price.   - `MarketPeg`: Price is set relative to far touch price.   - A `pegPriceType` submitted with no `ordType` is treated as a `Pegged` order.  #### Execution Instructions  The following `execInst`s are supported. If using multiple, separate with a comma (e.g. `LastPrice,Close`).  - **ParticipateDoNotInitiate**: Also known as a Post-Only order. If this order would have executed on placement, it will cancel instead.   This is intended to protect you from the far touch moving towards you while the order is in transit.   It is not intended for speculating on the far touch moving away after submission - we consider such behaviour abusive and monitor for it. - **MarkPrice, LastPrice, IndexPrice**: Used by stop and if-touched orders to determine the triggering price.   Use only one. By default, `MarkPrice` is used. Also used for Pegged orders to define the value of `LastPeg`. - **ReduceOnly**: A `ReduceOnly` order can only reduce your position, not increase it. If you have a `ReduceOnly`   limit order that rests in the order book while the position is reduced by other orders, then its order quantity will   be amended down or canceled. If there are multiple `ReduceOnly` orders the least aggressive will be amended first. - **Close**: `Close` implies `ReduceOnly`. A `Close` order will cancel other active limit orders with the same side   and symbol if the open quantity exceeds the current position. This is useful for stops: by canceling these orders, a   `Close` Stop is ensured to have the margin required to execute, and can only execute up to the full size of your   position. If `orderQty` is not specified, a `Close` order has an `orderQty` equal to your current position's size.   - Note that a `Close` order without an `orderQty` requires a `side`, so that BitMEX knows if it should trigger     above or below the `stopPx`. - **LastWithinMark**: Used by stop orders with `LastPrice` to allow stop triggers only when:   - For Sell Stop Market / Stop Limit Order     - Last Price &lt= Stop Price     - Last Price &gt= Mark Price × (1 - 5%)   - For Buy Stop Market / Stop Limit Order:     - Last Price &gt= Stop Price     - Last Price &lt= Mark Price × (1 + 5%) - **Fixed**: Pegged orders **must** have an `execInst` of `Fixed`. This means the limit price is set at the time   the order is accepted and does not change as the reference price changes.  #### Pegged Orders  Pegged orders allow users to submit a limit price relative to the current market price. The limit price is set once when the order is submitted and does not change with the reference price. This order type is not intended for speculating on the far touch moving away after submission - we consider such behaviour abusive and monitor for it.  Pegged orders have an `ordType` of `Pegged`, and an `execInst` of `Fixed`.  A `pegPriceType` and `pegOffsetValue` must also be submitted:  - `PrimaryPeg` - price is set relative to the **near touch** price - `MarketPeg` - price is set relative to the **far touch** price  #### Trailing Stop Pegged Orders  Use `pegPriceType` of `TrailingStopPeg` to create Trailing Stops.  The price is set at submission and updates once per second if the underlying price (last/mark/index) has moved by more than 0.1%. `stopPx` then moves as the market moves away from the peg, and freezes as the market moves toward it.  Use `pegOffsetValue` to set the `stopPx` of your order. The peg is set to the triggering price specified in the `execInst` (default `MarkPrice`). Use a negative offset for stop-sell and buy-if-touched orders.  Requires `ordType`: `Stop`, `StopLimit`, `MarketIfTouched`, `LimitIfTouched`.  #### Linked Orders  [Linked Orders are deprecated as of 2018/11/10](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/deprecation-of-contingent-orders/)  #### Trailing Stops  You may use `pegPriceType` of `'TrailingStopPeg'` to create Trailing Stops. The pegged `stopPx` will move as the market moves away from the peg, and freeze as the market moves toward it.  To use, combine with `pegOffsetValue` to set the `stopPx` of your order. The peg is set to the triggering price specified in the `execInst` (default `'MarkPrice'`). Use a negative offset for stop-sell and buy-if-touched orders.  Requires `ordType`: `'Stop', 'StopLimit', 'MarketIfTouched', 'LimitIfTouched'`.  #### Simple Quantities  [Simple Quantities are deprecated as of 2018/10/26](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/deprecation-of-simpleorderqty-functionality/)  #### Rate Limits  See the [Bulk Order Documentation](#!/Order/Order_newBulk) if you need to place multiple orders at the same time. Bulk orders require fewer risk checks in the trading engine and thus are ratelimited at **1/10** the normal rate.  You can also improve your reactivity to market movements while staying under your ratelimit by using the [Amend](#!/Order/Order_amend) and [Amend Bulk](#!/Order/Order_amendBulk) endpoints. This allows you to stay in the market and avoids the cancel/replace cycle.  #### Tracking Your Orders  If you want to keep track of order IDs yourself, set a unique `clOrdID` per order. This `clOrdID` will come back as a property on the order and any related executions (including on the WebSocket), and can be used to get or cancel the order. Max length is 36 characters.  You can also change the `clOrdID` by amending an order, supplying an `origClOrdID`, and your desired new ID as the `clOrdID` param, like so:  ``` # Amends an order's leavesQty, and updates its clOrdID to \"def-456\" PUT /api/v1/order {\"origClOrdID\": \"abc-123\", \"clOrdID\": \"def-456\", \"leavesQty\": 1000} ```
