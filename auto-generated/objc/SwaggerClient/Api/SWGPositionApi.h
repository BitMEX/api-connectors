* BitMEX API
* ## REST API for the BitMEX Trading Platform  _If you are building automated tools, please subscribe to the_ _[BitMEX API RSS Feed](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/feed/) for changes. The feed will be updated_ _regularly and is the most reliable way to get downtime and update announcements._  [View Changelog](/app/apiChangelog)  -  #### Getting Started  Base URI: [https://www.bitmex.com/api/v1](/api/v1)  ##### Fetching Data  All REST endpoints are documented below. You can try out any query right from this interface.  Most table queries accept `count`, `start`, and `reverse` params. Set `reverse=true` to get rows newest-first.  Additional documentation regarding filters, timestamps, and authentication is available in [the main API documentation](/app/restAPI).  _All_ table data is available via the [Websocket](/app/wsAPI). We highly recommend using the socket if you want to have the quickest possible data without being subject to ratelimits.  ##### Return Types  By default, all data is returned as JSON. Send `?_format=csv` to get CSV data or `?_format=xml` to get XML data.  ##### Trade Data Queries  _This is only a small subset of what is available, to get you started._  Fill in the parameters and click the `Try it out!` button to try any of these queries.  - [Pricing Data](#!/Quote/Quote_get)  - [Trade Data](#!/Trade/Trade_get)  - [OrderBook Data](#!/OrderBook/OrderBook_getL2)  - [Settlement Data](#!/Settlement/Settlement_get)  - [Exchange Statistics](#!/Stats/Stats_history)  Every function of the BitMEX.com platform is exposed here and documented. Many more functions are available.  ##### Swagger Specification  [⇩ Download Swagger JSON](swagger.json)  -  ## All API Endpoints  Click to expand a section.

/// Get your positions.
/// This endpoint is used for retrieving position information. The fields largely follow the [FIX spec](http://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/5.0.SP2/msgType_AP_6580.html) definitions. Some selected fields are explained in more detail below.  The fields _account_, _symbol_, _currency_ are unique to each position and form its key.  Spot trading symbols do not return any position data.  - **account**: Your unique account ID. - **symbol**: The contract for this position. - **currency**: The margin currency for this position. - **underlying**: Meta data of the _symbol_. - **quoteCurrency**: Meta data of the _symbol_, All prices are in the _quoteCurrency_ - **commission**: The maximum of the maker, taker, and settlement fee. - **initMarginReq**: The initial margin requirement. This will be at least the symbol's default initial maintenance margin, but can be higher if you choose lower leverage. - **maintMarginReq**: The maintenance margin requirement. This will be at least the symbol's default maintenance maintenance margin, but can be higher if you choose a higher risk limit. - **riskLimit**: This is a function of your _maintMarginReq_. - **leverage**: 1 / initMarginReq. - **crossMargin**: True/false depending on whether you set cross margin on this position. - **deleveragePercentile**: Indicates where your position is in the ADL queue. - **rebalancedPnl**: The value of realised PNL that has transferred to your wallet for this position. - **prevRealisedPnl**: The value of realised PNL that has transferred to your wallet for this position since the position was closed. - **currentQty**: The current position amount in contracts. - **currentCost**: The current cost of the position in the settlement currency of the symbol (_currency_). - **currentComm**: The current commission of the position in the settlement currency of the symbol (_currency_). - **realisedCost**: The realised cost of this position calculated with regard to average cost accounting. - **unrealisedCost**: _currentCost_ - _realisedCost_. - **grossOpenPremium**: The amount your bidding above the mark price in the settlement currency of the symbol (_currency_). - **markPrice**: The mark price of the symbol in _quoteCurrency_. - **markValue**: The _currentQty_ at the mark price in the settlement currency of the symbol (_currency_). - **homeNotional**: Value of position in units of _underlying_. - **foreignNotional**: Value of position in units of _quoteCurrency_. - **realisedPnl**: The negative of _realisedCost_. - **unrealisedPnl**: _unrealisedGrossPnl_. - **liquidationPrice**: Once markPrice reaches this price, this position will be liquidated. - **bankruptPrice**: Once markPrice reaches this price, this position will have no equity.
