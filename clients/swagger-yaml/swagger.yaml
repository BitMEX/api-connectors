    \n\n\n#### Getting Started\n\n\n##### Fetching Data\n\nAll REST endpoints are\
    \ documented below. You can try out any query right from this interface.\n\nMost\
    \ table queries accept `count`, `start`, and `reverse` params. Set `reverse=true`\
    \ to get rows newest-first.\n\nAdditional documentation regarding filters, timestamps,\
    \ and authentication\nis available in [the main API documentation](https://www.bitmex.com/app/restAPI).\n\
    \n*All* table data is available via the [Websocket](/app/wsAPI). We highly recommend\
    \ using the socket if you want\nto have the quickest possible data without being\
    \ subject to ratelimits.\n\n##### Return Types\n\nBy default, all data is returned\
    \ as JSON. Send `?_format=csv` to get CSV data or `?_format=xml` to get XML data.\n\
    \n##### Trade Data Queries\n\n*This is only a small subset of what is available,\
    \ to get you started.*\n\nFill in the parameters and click the `Try it out!` button\
    \ to try any of these queries.\n\n* [Pricing Data](#!/Quote/Quote_get)\n\n* [Trade\
    \ Data](#!/Trade/Trade_get)\n\n* [OrderBook Data](#!/OrderBook/OrderBook_getL2)\n\
    \n* [Settlement Data](#!/Settlement/Settlement_get)\n\n* [Exchange Statistics](#!/Stats/Stats_history)\n\
    \nEvery function of the BitMEX.com platform is exposed here and documented. Many\
    \ more functions are available.\n\n##### Swagger Specification\n\n[⇩ Download\
    \ Swagger JSON](swagger.json)\n\n\n\n## All API Endpoints\n\nClick to expand a\

      description: "## Placing Orders\n\nThis endpoint is used for placing orders.\
        \ See individual fields below for more details on their use.\n\n#### Order\
        \ Types\n\nAll orders require a `symbol`. All other fields are optional except\
        \ when otherwise specified.\n\nThese are the valid `ordType`s:\n\n* **Limit**:\
        \ The default order type. Specify an `orderQty` and `price`.\n* **Market**:\
        \ A traditional Market order. A Market order will execute until filled or\
        \ your bankruptcy price is reached, at\n  which point it will cancel.\n* **MarketWithLeftOverAsLimit**:\
        \ A market order that, after eating through the order book as far as\n  permitted\
        \ by available margin, will become a limit order. The difference between this\
        \ type and `Market` only\n  affects the behavior in thin books. Upon reaching\
        \ the deepest possible price, if there is quantity left over,\n  a `Market`\
        \ order will cancel the remaining quantity. `MarketWithLeftOverAsLimit` will\
        \ keep the remaining\n  quantity in the books as a `Limit`.\n* **Stop**: A\
        \ Stop Market order. Specify an `orderQty` and `stopPx`. When the `stopPx`\
        \ is reached, the order will be entered\n  into the book.\n  * On sell orders,\
        \ the order will trigger if the triggering price is lower than the `stopPx`.\
        \ On buys, higher.\n  * Note: Stop orders do not consume margin until triggered.\
        \ Be sure that the required margin is available in your\n    account so that\
        \ it may trigger fully.\n  * `Close` Stops don't require an `orderQty`. See\
        \ Execution Instructions below.\n* **StopLimit**: Like a Stop Market, but\
        \ enters a Limit order instead of a Market order. Specify an `orderQty`, `stopPx`,\n\
        \  and `price`.\n* **MarketIfTouched**: Similar to a Stop, but triggers are\
        \ done in the opposite direction. Useful for Take Profit orders.\n* **LimitIfTouched**:\
        \ As above; use for Take Profit Limit orders.\n\n#### Execution Instructions\n\
        \nThe following `execInst`s are supported. If using multiple, separate with\
        \ a comma (e.g. `LastPrice,Close`).\n\n* **ParticipateDoNotInitiate**: Also\
        \ known as a Post-Only order. If this order would have executed on placement,\n\
        \  it will cancel instead.\n* **AllOrNone**: Valid only for hidden orders\
        \ (`displayQty: 0`). Use to only execute if the entire order would fill.\n\
        * **MarkPrice, LastPrice, IndexPrice**: Used by stop and if-touched orders\
        \ to determine the triggering price.\n  Use only one. By default, `'MarkPrice'`\
        \ is used. Also used for Pegged orders to define the value of `'LastPeg'`.\n\
        * **ReduceOnly**: A `'ReduceOnly'` order can only reduce your position, not\
        \ increase it. If you have a `'ReduceOnly'`\n  limit order that rests in the\
        \ order book while the position is reduced by other orders, then its order\
        \ quantity will\n  be amended down or canceled. If there are multiple `'ReduceOnly'`\
        \ orders the least agresssive will be amended first.\n* **Close**: `'Close'`\
        \ implies `'ReduceOnly'`. A `'Close'` order will cancel other active limit\
        \ orders with the same side\n  and symbol if the open quantity exceeds the\
        \ current position. This is useful for stops: by canceling these orders, a\n\
        \  `'Close'` Stop is ensured to have the margin required to execute, and can\
        \ only execute up to the full size of your\n  position. If not specified,\
        \ a `'Close'` order has an `orderQty` equal to your current position's size.\n\
        \n#### Linked Orders\n\nLinked Orders are an advanced capability. It is very\
        \ powerful, but its use requires careful coding and testing.\nPlease follow\
        \ this document carefully and use the [Testnet Exchange](https://testnet.bitmex.com)\
        \ while developing.\n\nBitMEX offers four advanced Linked Order types:\n\n\
        * **OCO**: *One Cancels the Other*. A very flexible version of the standard\
        \ Stop / Take Profit technique.\n  Multiple orders may be linked together\
        \ using a single `clOrdLinkID`. Send a `contingencyType` of\n  `OneCancelsTheOther`\
        \ on the orders. The first order that fully or partially executes (or activates\n\
        \  for `Stop` orders) will cancel all other orders with the same `clOrdLinkID`.\n\
        * **OTO**: *One Triggers the Other*. Send a `contingencyType` of `'OneTriggersTheOther'`\
        \ on the primary order and\n  then subsequent orders with the same `clOrdLinkID`\
        \ will be not be triggered until the primary order fully executes.\n* **OUOA**:\
        \ *One Updates the Other Absolute*. Send a `contingencyType` of `'OneUpdatesTheOtherAbsolute'`\
        \ on the orders. Then\n  as one order has a execution, other orders with the\
        \ same `clOrdLinkID` will have their order quantity amended\n  down by the\
        \ execution quantity.\n* **OUOP**: *One Updates the Other Proportional*. Send\
        \ a `contingencyType` of `'OneUpdatesTheOtherProportional'` on the orders.\
        \ Then\n  as one order has a execution, other orders with the same `clOrdLinkID`\
        \ will have their order quantity reduced proportionally\n  by the fill percentage.\n\
        \n#### Trailing Stops\n\nYou may use `pegPriceType` of `'TrailingStopPeg'`\
        \ to create Trailing Stops. The pegged `stopPx` will move as the market\n\
        moves away from the peg, and freeze as the market moves toward it.\n\nTo use,\
        \ combine with `pegOffsetValue` to set the `stopPx` of your order. The peg\
        \ is set to the triggering price\nspecified in the `execInst` (default `'MarkPrice'`).\
        \ Use a negative offset for stop-sell and buy-if-touched orders.\n\nRequires\
        \ `ordType`: `'Stop', 'StopLimit', 'MarketIfTouched', 'LimitIfTouched'`.\n\
        \n#### Simple Quantities\n\nSend a `simpleOrderQty` instead of an `orderQty`\
        \ to create an order denominated in the underlying currency.\nThis is useful\
        \ for opening up a position with 1 XBT of exposure without having to calculate\
        \ how many contracts it is.\n\n#### Rate Limits\n\nSee the [Bulk Order Documentation](#!/Order/Order_newBulk)\
        \ if you need to place multiple orders at the same time.\nBulk orders require\
        \ fewer risk checks in the trading engine and thus are ratelimited at **1/10**\
        \ the normal rate.\n\nYou can also improve your reactivity to market movements\
        \ while staying under your ratelimit by using the\n[Amend](#!/Order/Order_amend)\
        \ and [Amend Bulk](#!/Order/Order_amendBulk) endpoints. This allows you to\
        \ stay\nin the market and avoids the cancel/replace cycle.\n\n#### Tracking\
        \ Your Orders\n\nIf you want to keep track of order IDs yourself, set a unique\
        \ `clOrdID` per order.\nThis `clOrdID` will come back as a property on the\
        \ order and any related executions (including on the WebSocket),\nand can\
        \ be used to get or cancel the order. Max length is 36 characters.\n"
