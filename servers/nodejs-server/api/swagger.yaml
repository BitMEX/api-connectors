        \ Market, Limit, Stop, StopLimit, MarketIfTouched, LimitIfTouched, MarketWithLeftOverAsLimit,\
        \ and Pegged.\n\nIf no order type is provided, BitMEX will assume 'Limit'.\n\
        Be very careful with 'Market' and 'Stop' orders as you may be filled at an\
        \ unfavourable price.\n\nYou can submit bulk orders by POSTing an array of\
        \ orders to `/api/v1/order/bulk`. Send a JSON payload\nwith the shape: `{\"\
        orders\": [{...}, {...}]}`, with each inner object containing the same fields\
        \ that would be\nsent to this endpoint.\n\nA note on API tools: if you want\
        \ to keep track of order IDs yourself, set a unique clOrdID per order.\nThis\
        \ clOrdID will come back as a property on the order and any related executions\
        \ (including on the WebSocket),\nand can be used to get or cancel the order.\
        \ Max length is 36 characters.\n\nTo generate a clOrdID, consider setting\
        \ a prefix, and incrementing a counter or generating a UUID.\nSome UUIDs are\
        \ longer than 36 characters, so use a url-safe base64 encoding. For example,\
        \ the prefix `'bmex_mm_'`\nand the UUID `'7fbd6545-bb0c-11e4-a273-6003088a7c04'`\
        \ creates `'bmex_mm_f71lRbsMEeSic2ADCIp8BA'`.\n\nSee the [BitMEX Reference\
